This starter project uses the same code as the final capstone. It has security/authorization added that has nor been discussed yet. We will cover that material on another day. On the server side it also includes modified database scripts to create the JGHomes database as well as all server side code from M2 final review. Everything else is exactly what you will receive for your starter code.
