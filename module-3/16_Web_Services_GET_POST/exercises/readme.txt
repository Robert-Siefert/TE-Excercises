The POST exercise has the solution to the GET exercise built into it. Since the GET exercise is optional, 
you may want to at least read and get familiar with what the GET exercise entailed. This is because the 
POST exercise instructions refers to things you did in the earlier exercise. Ideally, you do both, but only
the POST exercise will be graded.
